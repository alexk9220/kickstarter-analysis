Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends

#**Overview of project**
Louise have collected enough money to launch her play Fever and now needs to know when is the best time to launch it. Having thoroughly analyzied the kickstrater database with the tools Excel has to offer, I can give her some recommendations based on my findings.

##**Outcomes Based on Launch Date Analysis and Challenges**

###**May is the best month to launch a play**

As we can conclude from our Launch Date vs Outcomes chart, it's clear that May is the best time to launch a play as May shows us the greatest success rate out of all months. So it will make the most sense for Louis to launch her play in May as statistically the chance of success is the highest during this month. June seems to be quite succesfull too so it can aslo be an option to consider.

Our dataset doesn't specify where exactly plays are launched (country) so that might also be a good point to take into account. 

###**Spring is historically the best season to launch a play**

The kickstarter data shows us that the success rate of plays is going up starting from March up until May so if it's not possible to launch your play in May it's also safe to consider March and April. Winter months, however show very low success rates compared to the rest of the year, also not so many launches take place in the winter to begin with. While it signifies that winter months are not historically favoured by both producers and thater goers, it can possibly be a great buisness opportunity if you are 100% sure that your play will succeed as there is not much competition in the industry overall this time a year.    

##**Results**
The absolue best time to launch Louise's play is May as historically it's the most successful time. Spring months are overall favourable so it's better to launch plays during spring months. Winter months are the worst overall for both producers and thater goers (not as many projects - not a lot of those few are successful.  

##**Outcomes Based Goals Analysis and Challenges**

###**There is no direct correlation between the ammount of money projected and success 

Based on our data it's clear that the more money invested - the more successful rule doesn't exactly work in thater world. Over the years it's been proven that the ammount of money involved doesn't guarantee success. 

##**Low budget plays generally tend to do well

Based on our chart it's clear that low budgeted plays with low goal ammounts tend to succeed. Even though the competition is the toughest (total ammount of projects is much higher for low budget plays), low budget plays are generally successful. At the same time high budget plays can be successful but they mostly do well while there are no other projects in the same budget category.

##**Results**
The more money involoved the - the greater success rule doesn't apply to the theater industry as there is no direct correlation between the ammount of money involved and success. However, low budget plays tend do well despite much very tough competition, high budget plays seem to do well when they are launched at the time when not so many other high budget projects are present. It seems that it's a lot easier to become successful if the budget is modest so Louise should consider that.
